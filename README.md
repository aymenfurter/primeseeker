Prime Number Predictor
======================

This project contains a model that can predict whether or not a number is prime. The model is implemented using PyTorch, and it consists of a feedforward neural network with three hidden layers.

Getting Started
---------------

To use this model, you will need to have PyTorch installed. You can install PyTorch by following the instructions on the [official website](https://pytorch.org/).

Once you have PyTorch installed, you can run the `main.py` script to train and evaluate the model.

`python main.py`

Model Details
-------------
